/*
        STL (Standard Template Library)

        STL = Containers + Algorithms + Iterators
        STL Componenets:
        Containers:
            Object which stores data
        Algorithms:
            Procedure which process data
        Iterators:
            Object which points to an element of Container
        

        Containers:
        1-> Sequence Containers 
            a-> Linear Fashion
                (i)     Vector
                (ii)    List
                (iii)   Dequeue
        2-> Associative Containers (Faster than Sequence Containers because of faster searching, deletion etc)
            a-> Direct Access (Example : Tree)
                (i)     Set / Multiset
                (ii)    Maps / Multimaps
        3-> Derived Containers
            a-> Real World Modeling (Example: Stack, Queue, Priority Queue etc)


        When to use which one?
        Sequence Containers:
            1-> Vector (Random access is fast but insertion and deletion is slow, But insertion at the end is fast)
            2-> List (Random access is slow, Middle Insertion is fast, deletion and insertion at the end is fast)
        Associative Containers:
            1-> All Operation are fast except random access
        Derived Containers:
            Speed depends and need analysis because we are using Real World Modeling
