# CPP Practice Sets

## Repository Overview

Welcome to the **CPP Practice Sets** repository! This collection contains the C++ practice files I created during my BS Computer Science studies. These files span across multiple semesters and represent my journey of learning and mastering the C++ programming language. This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. **Public Codebase**: To make my code publicly available for others to learn from and explore.
2. **Online Backup**: To have my practice sets safely stored and accessible online.
3. **Cherished Memories**: These files represent a significant phase of my coding journey, a time when I immersed myself in learning C++.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### 1. **MyOwn_PracticeSets**
This folder contains the practice files I wrote on my own to explore various C++ concepts. These files reflect my independent efforts to learn and experiment with C++ in a different way. Some of the concepts I practiced include:
- Programming fundamentals (from the 1st semester)
- A few concepts from the Standard Template Library (STL) that I learned from another video
- Miscellaneous C++ concepts that I explored on my own

Additionally, there is a `TW.h` file in this folder. This is a custom header file I created for my projects, containing functions that I frequently used while working on various projects.

### 2. **CodeWithHarry_PracticeSets**
This folder includes files I practiced while following the CodeWithHarry C++ course. These practice sets correspond to videos 7 through 74 and cover topics introduced in the course. They reflect my efforts to reinforce concepts taught by CodeWithHarry.

## My Learning Journey with C++

C++ was the very first language that built the foundation of my programming skills. Here’s a brief overview of my learning journey:

- **1st Semester**: I studied **Programming Fundamentals**, and a few files in this repository were created during this time.
- **2nd Semester**: I studied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java, but I struggled to grasp some concepts well.
- **3rd Semester**: I studied **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, and a few files were created during this semester.
- **4th Semester**: I continued to explore C++ and created a few more files during this time.
- **After 4th Semester**: During the 2-month summer vacation, I downloaded the entire **CodeWithHarry C++ Course** playlist. I skipped the basic concepts and started watching from the 7th video, practicing each concept as I went along.

## Why C++ is Special to Me

C++ holds a special place in my heart as it was the language that introduced me to the world of programming. It taught me:
- Core programming principles
- Efficient problem-solving
- Memory management and low-level programming concepts

These practice sets represent the early days of my programming journey and remind me of the excitement and challenges of learning C++.

## A Note on Learning Programming

I believe that if someone wants to become a **good programmer**, they should start with C++. It’s a language that teaches you:
- Core programming principles
- Efficient problem-solving
- Memory management and low-level programming concepts

C++ equips you with a strong foundation, making it easier to learn other programming languages later.

## About Me

My name is Muhammad Ilyas. I created these practice sets during my BS Computer Science degree. While I have since moved on to Python and completed numerous projects, C++ remains my first love in programming. I’m sharing this repository not just as a learning resource but also as a tribute to the language that started it all.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone or download the repository to your local system.
2. Explore the directories:
   - Start with **CodeWithHarry_PracticeSets** for structured learning based on the CodeWithHarry course.
   - Check out **MyOwn_PracticeSets** for independently written practice files.
3. Use the files to learn C++ concepts or as inspiration for your own practice.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Ilyas-Ibrahim/CPP-Practice-Sets.git
```

## Final Thoughts

C++ was more than just a programming language for me; it was a teacher, a challenge, and a companion during the early days of my programming journey. I hope this repository helps others discover the beauty of C++ and inspires them to start their own coding journey.

If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
